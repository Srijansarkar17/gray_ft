- ### MeetStream AI Agent

- *MeetStream Agent* is a Flask-based application that integrates with the MeetStream API to extract zoom and google meeting transcripts and automate follow-up tasks.

- The application uses *Groq AI* to analyze meeting transcripts for scheduling intents and task assignments, then automates the creation of calendar events and notification of task assignments.

- *Core functionality* includes:
  - Creating and removing MeetStream bots for transcript collection
  - Processing meeting transcripts using Groq AI to identify action items
  - Automatically creating Google Calendar events based on scheduling intents
  - Sending task assignments to meeting participants via email and Slack

- *Integration with multiple services*:
  - Google OAuth for Calendar and Gmail access
  - Slack for sending task notifications
  - Groq AI for natural language processing of transcripts
  - MeetStream API for bot creation and transcript retrieval

- *Contact management* through a CSV file that maps names to email addresses and Slack IDs, with intelligent partial name matching for identifying task assignees mentioned in meetings.

- *Key endpoints*:
  - /create_bot - Creates a MeetStream bot and stores its ID
  - /fetch_transcript - Retrieves and processes meeting transcripts
  - /remove_bot - Removes the current MeetStream bot
  - /authorize_google - Handles Google OAuth authentication
  - /send_task_notification_manual - Manually sends task notifications
  - /set_slack_token - Configures Slack integration
  - /set_contacts_csv_path - Sets the path to the contacts database

- *Task notification system* that:
  - Formats and sends professional email notifications via Gmail API
  - Creates formatted Slack messages with task details and due dates
  - Tracks successful notifications in the system's response

- *Calendar event creation* that builds detailed Google Calendar events with:
  - Auto-detected meeting title, time and description
  - Proper formatting of attendee lists and location information
  - Appropriate timezone settings and reminders

- *Security features* include:
  - OAuth 2.0 for Google API access
  - Environment variable storage for API keys
  - Token persistence for maintaining authorized sessions
  - Secure session management in the Flask application

- *Error handling* throughout the application provides graceful degradation when services are unavailable, with detailed logging of issues encountered.

- The application serves as a comprehensive meeting assistant that eliminates manual follow-up tasks by automatically identifying and executing on action items from meeting transcripts.
